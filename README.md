# Drew Bomhof's dot files
This is how I build my current environment

Thanks to [r00k](http://github.com/r00k/dotfiles) for the vim-script functions
and a large number of the aliases / ruby snippets

## Installation

  `git clone git://github.com/syncrou/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`  
  `cd ~/.dotfiles`  
  `rake install`

  Vim plugins are managed through vundle. Vundle will need to be installed to get them.

  `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`  
  Run :BundleInstall in vim.
